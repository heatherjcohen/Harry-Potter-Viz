       "' Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling hed had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And dont you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddys birthday.\" Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing...\" Dudleys birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudleys birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudleys favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldnt often catch him. Harry didnt look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudleys, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And dont ask questions.\" Dont ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasnt much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"Thats two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you havent counted Auntie Marges present, see, its here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And well buy you another two presents while were out today. Hows that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So Ill have thirty ... thirty...\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his moneys worth, just like his father. Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudleys hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figgs broken her leg. She cant take him.\" She jerked her head in Harrys direction. Dudleys mouth fell open in horror, but Harrys heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudleys birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever owned. \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though hed planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Dont be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasnt there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them, like a slug. \"What about whats-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (hed be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudleys computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \"I wont blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they werent listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \"... and leave him in the car....\" \"That cars new, hes not sitting in it alone....\" Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasnt really crying -- it had been years since hed really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, dont cry, Mummy wont let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I... dont... want... him... t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp- spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang -- \"Oh, good Lord, theyre here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudleys best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldnt believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before theyd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"Im warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harrys, \"Im warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and youll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" \"Im not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly.. But Uncle Vernon didnt believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didnt make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudleys (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldnt fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasnt punished. On the other hand, hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harrys surprise as anyone elses, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harrys headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all hed tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figgs cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered. I know they dont,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" But he wished he hadnt said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasnt bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasnt blond. Harry had the best morning hed had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernons car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didnt look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didnt budge. \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harrys. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They werent. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time. \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" The snake nodded vigorously. \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see -- so youve never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT ITS DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernons car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, werent you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. Hed lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from. He couldnt remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudleys gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudleys gang. '"

friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother.', 'Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat.', 'He was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them.', 'Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.', 'Half an hour later, Harry, who couldnt believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life.', 'His aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before theyd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.', '\"Im warning you,\" he had said, putting

anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly..', 'But Uncle Vernon didnt believe him.', 'No one ever did.', 'The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didnt make them happen.', 'Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\"', 'Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.', 'Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly.', 'Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudleys (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldnt fit Harry.', 'Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasnt punished.', 'On the other hand, hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.', 'Dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harrys surprise as anyone elses, there he was sitting on the chimney.', 'The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harrys headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings.', 'But all hed tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors.', 'Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump.', 'But today, nothing was going to go wrong.', 'It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figgs cabbage-smelling living room.', 'While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia.', 'He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects.', 'This morning, it was motorcycles.',

Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front.', 'He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY!\"', 'Dudley and Piers sniggered.', 'I know they dont,\" said Harry.', '\"It was only a dream.\"', 'But he wished he hadnt said anything.', 'If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.', 'It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families.', 'The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop.', 'It wasnt bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasnt blond.', 'Harry had the best morning hed had in a long time.', 'He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him.', 'They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.', 'Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.', 'After lunch they went to the reptile house.', 'It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls.', 'Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone.', 'Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.', 'Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place.', 'It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernons car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didnt look in the mood.', 'In fact, it was fast asleep.', 'Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.', '\"Make it move,\" he whined at his father.', 'Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didnt budge.', '\"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered.', 'Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.', '\"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned.', 'He shuffled away.', 'Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake.', 'He wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long.', 'It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.', 'The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes.', 'Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harrys.', 'It winked.', 'Harry stared.', 'Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching.', 'They werent.', 'He looked back at the snake and winked, too.', 'The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling.', 'It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.', '\"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him.', '\"It must be really annoying.\"', 'The snake nodded vigorously.', '\"Where do you come from, anyway?\"', 'Harry asked.', 'The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass.', 'Harry peered at it.', 'Boa Constrictor, Brazil.', '\"Was it nice there?\"', 'The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo.', '\"Oh, I see -- so youve never been to Brazil?\"', 'As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump.', '\"DUDLEY!', 'MR.

decided ter kill em, no one except you, an hed killed some o the best witches an wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts -- an you was only a baby, an you lived.\"', 'Something very painful was going on in Harrys mind.', 'As Hagrids story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.', 'Hagrid was watching him sadly.', '\"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledores orders.', 'Brought yeh ter this lot...\" \"Load of old tosh,\" said Uncle Vernon.', 'Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there.', 'Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage.', 'He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.', '\"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept theres something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the worlds better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types --

his cupboard?', 'If hed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?', '\"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake.', 'I dont think I can be a wizard.\"', 'To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.', '\"Not a wizard, eh?', 'Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\"', 'Harry looked into the fire.', 'Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudleys gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, hed managed to make it grow back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadnt he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it?', 'Hadnt he set a boa constrictor on him?', 'Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.', '\"See?\"',

and Hagrids heavy coat fell off him.', 'The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.', 'Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him.', 'He went straight to the window and jerked it open.', 'The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didnt wake up.', 'The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrids coat.', '\"Dont do that.\"', 'Harry tried to wave the owl out of

bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.', 'Then he flew off through the open window.', 'Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and

ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.', '\"I dont know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.', 'Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him.', 'They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand.', 'This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.', 'Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them?', 'Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks?', 'Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up?', 'If Harry hadnt known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldnt help trusting him.',

was there.', 'The people hurrying by didnt glance at it.', 'Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the Leaky Cauldron at all.', 'In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it.', 'Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.', 'For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby.', 'A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry.', 'One of them was smoking a long pipe.', 'A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut.', 'The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in.', 'Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"', '\"Cant, Tom, Im on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harrys shoulder and making Harrys knees buckle.', '\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this be --?\"', 'The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.', '\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what an honor.\"',

at him.', 'The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.', 'Hagrid was beaming.', 'Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself

your hand -- Im all of a flutter.\"', '\"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just cant tell you, Diggles the name, Dedalus Diggle.\"', '\"Ive seen you before!\"', 'said Harry, as Dedalus Diggles top hat fell off in his excitement.', '\"You bowed to me once in a shop.\"', '\"He remembers!\"', 'cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.', '\"Did you hear that?', 'He remembers me!\"', 'Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.', 'A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously.', 'One of his eyes was twitching.', '\"Professor Quirrell!\"', 'said Hagrid.',

it, eh, P-P-Potter?\"', 'He laughed nervously.', '\"Youll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose?', 'Ive g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\"', 'He looked terrified at the very thought.', 'But the others wouldnt let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself.', 'It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all.', 'At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.', '\"Must get on -- lots ter buy.', 'Come on, Harry.\"', 'Doris Crockford shook Harrys hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.', 'Hagrid grinned at Harry.', '\"Told yeh, didnt I?', 'Told yeh you was famous.', 'Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh -- mind you, hes usually tremblin.\"', '\"Is he always that nervous?\"', '\"Oh, yeah.', 'Poor bloke.', 'Brilliant mind.', 'He was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....', 'They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.', 'Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, wheres me umbrella?\"', 'Vampires?', 'Hags?', 'Harrys head was swimming.', 'Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.', '\"Three up... two across he muttered.', '\"Right, stand back, Harry.\"', 'He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.', 'The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.', '\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\"', 'He grinned at Harrys amazement.', 'They stepped through the archway.', 'Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.', 'The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.', 'Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring -- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.', '\"Yeah, youll be needin one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first.\"', 'Harry wished he had about eight more eyes.', 'He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping.', 'A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, theyre mad....\" A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy.', 'Several boys of about Harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it.', '\"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever --\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.... \"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.', 'They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops.', 'Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was - \"Yeah, thats a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him.', 'The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.', 'He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet.', 'He bowed as they walked inside.', 'Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn.', 'So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.', '\"Like I said, Yehd be mad ter try an rob it,\" said Hagrid.', 'A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall.', 'About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.', 'There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these.', 'Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.', '\"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin.', '\"Weve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potters safe.\"', '\"You have his key, Sir?\"', '\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers.', 'The goblin wrinkled his nose.', 'Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.', '\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.', 'The goblin looked at it closely.', '\"That seems to be in order.\"', '\"An Ive also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest.', '\"Its about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\"', 'The goblin read the letter carefully.', '\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have Someone take you down to both vaults.', 'Griphook!\"', 'Griphook was yet another goblin.', 'Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.', '\"Whats the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\"', 'Harry asked.', '\"Cant tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously.', '\"Very secret.', 'Hogwarts business.', 'Dumbledores trusted me.', 'Moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh that.\"', 'Griphook held the door open for them.', 'Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised.', 'They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches.', 'It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor.', 'Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them.', 'They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off.', 'At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.', 'Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.', 'The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasnt steering.', 'Harrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open.', 'Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.', 'I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"whats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"', '\"Stalagmites got an m in it,\" said Hagrid.', '\"An don ask me questions just now, I think Im gonna be sick.\"', 'He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.', 'Griphook unlocked the door.', 'A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped.', 'Inside were mounds of gold coins.', 'Columns of silver.', 'Heaps of little bronze Knuts.', '\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.', 'All Harrys -- it was incredible.', 'The Dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking.', 'How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep?', 'And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.', 'Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.', '\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained.', '\"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, its easy enough.', 'Right, that should be enough fer a couple o terms, well keep the rest safe for yeh.\"', 'He turned to Griphook.', '\"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\"', '\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.', 'They were going even deeper now and gathering speed.', 'The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners.', 'They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.', 'Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.', '\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly.', 'He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.', '\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, theyd be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook.', '\"How often do you check to see if anyones inside?\"', 'Harry asked.', '\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.', 'Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty.', 'Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor.', 'Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat.', 'Harry longed to know what it was,

his head and the boy sat down.', 'He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadnt looked.', 'Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.', '\"Hey, Ron.\"', 'The twins were back.', '\"Listen, were going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordans got a giant tarantula down there.\"', '\"Right,\" mumbled Ron.', '\"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves?', 'Fred and George Weasley.', 'And this is Ron, our brother.', 'See you later, then.', '\"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron.', 'The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.', '\"Are you really Harry Potter?\"', 'Ron blurted out.', 'Harry nodded.', '\"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and Georges jokes,\" said Ron.', '\"And have you really got -- you know...\" He pointed at Harrys forehead.', 'Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar.', 'Ron stared.', '\"So thats where You-Know-Who \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I cant remember it.\"', '\"Nothing?\"', 'said Ron eagerly.', '\"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\"', '\"Wow,\" said Ron.', 'He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.', '\"Are all your family wizards?\"', 'asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.', '\"Er -- Yes, I think so,\" said Ron.', '\"I think Moms got a second cousin whos an accountant, but we never talk about him.\"', '\"So you must know loads of magic already.\"', 'The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.', '\"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron.', '\"What are they like?\"', '\"Horrible -well, not all of them.', 'My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though.', 'Wish Id had three wizard brothers.\"', '\"Five,\" said Ron.', 'For some reason, he was looking gloomy.', '\"Im the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts.', 'You could say Ive got a lot to live up to.', 'Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch.', 'Now Percys a prefect.', 'Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks theyre really funny.', 'Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, its no big deal, because they did it first.', 'You never get anything new, either, with five brothers.', 'Ive got Bills old robes, Charlies old wand, and Percys old rat.\"', 'Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.', '\"His names Scabbers and hes useless, he hardly ever wakes up.', 'Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldnt aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\"', 'Rons ears went pink.', 'He seemed to think hed said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.', 'Harry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl.', 'After all, hed never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.', 'This seemed to cheer Ron up.', '\"... and until Hagrid told me, I didnt know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort\" Ron gasped.', '\"What?\"', 'said Harry.', '\"You said You-Know-Whos name!\"', 'said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed.', '\"Id have thought you, of all people --\" \"Im not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, I just never knew you shouldnt.', 'See what I mean?', 'Ive got loads to learn....', 'I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet Im the worst in the class.\"', '\"You wont be.', 'Theres loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\"', 'While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.', 'Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep.', 'They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.', 'Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears?\"', 'Harry, who hadnt had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Rons ears went pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches.', 'Harry went out into the corridor.', 'He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didnt have Mars Bars.', 'What she did have were Bettie Botts Every Flavor Beans, Droobles Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs.', 'Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life.', 'Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.', 'Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.', '\"Hungry, are you?\"', '\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.', 'Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it.', 'There were four sandwiches inside.', 'He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She always forgets I dont like corned beef.\"', '\"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty.', '\"Go on --\" \"You dont want this, its all dry,\" said Ron.', '\"She hasnt got much time,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\"', '\"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with.', 'It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harrys pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).', '\"What are these?\"', 'Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.', '\"Theyre not really frogs, are they?\"', 'He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.', '\"No,\" said Ron.', '\"But see what the card is.', 'Im missing Agrippa.\"', '\"What?\"', '\"Oh, of course, you wouldnt know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards.', 'Ive got about five hundred, but I havent got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\"', 'Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card.', 'It showed a mans face.', 'He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache.', 'Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.', '\"So this is Dumbledore!\"', 'said Harry.', '\"Dont tell me youd never heard of Dumbledore!\"', 'said Ron.', '\"Can I have a frog?', 'I might get Agrippa -- thanks Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.', 'Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.', 'Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledores face had disappeared.', '\"Hes gone!\"', '\"Well, you cant expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron.', '\"Hell be back.', 'No, Ive got Morgana again and Ive got about six of her... do you want it?', 'You can start collecting.\"', 'Rons eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.', '\"Help yourself,\" said Harry.', '\"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\"', '\"Do they?', 'What, they dont move at all?\"', 'Ron sounded amazed.', '\"weird!\"', 'Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile.', 'Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldnt keep his eyes off them.', 'Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.', 'He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans.', '\"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry.', '\"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe.', 'George reckons he had a boogerflavored one once.\"', 'Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.', '\"Bleaaargh -- see?', 'Sprouts.\"', 'They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans.', 'Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldnt touch, which turned out to be pepper.', 'The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder.', 'The neat fields had gone.', 'Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.', 'There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in.', 'He looked tearful.', '\"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\"', 'When they shook their heads, he wailed, \"Ive lost him!', 'He keeps getting away from me!\"', '\"Hell turn up,\" said Harry.', '\"Yes,\" said the boy miserably.', '\"Well, if you see him...\" He left.', '\"Dont know why hes so bothered,\" said Ron.', '\"If Id brought a toad Id lose it as quick as I could.', 'Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I cant talk.\"', 'The rat was still snoozing on Rons lap.', '\"He might have died and you wouldnt know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust.', '\"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didnt work.', 'Ill show you, look...\" He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand.', 'It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.', '\"Unicorn hairs nearly poking out.', 'Anyway He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again.', 'The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him.', 'She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.', '\"Has anyone seen a toad?', 'Nevilles lost one,\" she said.', 'She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.', '\"Weve already told him we havent seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasnt listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.', '\"Oh, are you doing magic?', 'Lets see it, then.\"', 'She sat down.', 'Ron looked taken aback.', '\"Er -- all right.\"', 'He cleared his throat.', '\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\"', 'He waved his wand, but nothing happened.', 'Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.', '\"Are you sure thats a real spell?\"', 'said the girl.', '\"Well, its not very good, is it?', 'Ive tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me.', 'Nobody in my familys magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, its the very best school of witchcraft there is, Ive heard -- Ive learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- Im Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.', 'She said all this very fast.', 'Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnt learned all the course books by heart either.', '\"Im Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered.', '\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry.', '\"Are you really?\"', 'said Hermione.', '\"I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books.', 'for background reading, and youre in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.', '\"Am I?\"', 'said Harry, feeling dazed.', '\"Goodness, didnt you know, Id have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione.', '\"Do either of you know what house youll be in?', 'Ive been asking around, and I hope Im in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldnt be too bad....', 'Anyway, wed better go and look for Nevilles toad.', 'You two had better change, you know, I expect well be there soon.\"', 'And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.', '\"Whatever house Im in, I hope shes not in it,\" said Ron.', 'He threw his wand back into his trunk.', '\"Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\"', '\"What house are your brothers in?\"', 'asked Harry.', '\"Gryffindor,\" said Ron.', 'Gloom seemed to be settling on him again.', '\"Mom and Dad were in it, too.', 'I dont know what theyll say if Im not.', 'I dont suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\"', '\"Thats the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\"', '\"Yeah,\" said Ron.', 'He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.', '\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers whiskers are a bit lighter,\" said Harry, trying to take Rons mind off houses.', '\"So what do your oldest brothers do now that theyve left, anyway?\"', 'Harry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished school.', '\"Charlies in Romania studying dragons, and Bills in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron.', '\"Did you hear about Gringotts?', 'Its been all over the Daily Prophet, but I dont suppose you get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault.\"', 'Harry stared.', '\"Really?', 'What happened to them?\"', '\"Nothing, thats why its such big news.', 'They havent been caught.', 'My dad says it mustve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they dont think they took anything, thats whats odd.', 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Whos behind it.\"', 'Harry turned this news over in his mind.', 'He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned.', 'He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying.', '\"Whats your Quidditch team?\"', 'Ron asked.', '\"Er -- I dont know any,\" Harry confessed.', '\"What!\"', 'Ron looked dumbfounded.', '\"Oh, you wait, its the best game in the world --\" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games hed been to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the money.', 'He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasnt Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.', 'Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkins robe shop.', 'He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than hed shown back in Diagon Alley.', '\"Is it true?\"', 'he said.', '\"Theyre saying all down the train that Harry Potters in this compartment.', 'So its you, is it?\"', '\"Yes,\" said Harry.', 'He was looking at the other boys.', 'Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean.', 'Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.', '\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking.', '\"And my names Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\"', 'Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget.', 'Draco Malfoy looked at him.', '\"Think my names funny, do you?', 'No need to ask who you are.', 'My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\"', 'He turned back to Harry.', '\"Youll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter.', 'You dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort.', 'I can help you there.\"', 'He held out his hand to shake Harrys, but Harry didnt take it.', '\"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly.', 'Draco Malfoy didnt go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.', '\"Id be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly.', '\"Unless youre a bit politer youll go the same way as your parents.', 'They didnt know what was good for them, either.', 'You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and itll rub off on you.\"', 'Both Harry and Ron stood up.', '\"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair.', '\"Oh, youre going to fight us, are you?\"', 'Malfoy sneered.', '\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.', '\"But we dont feet like leaving, do we, boys?', 'Weve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\"', 'Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward, but before hed so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.', 'Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyles knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once.', 'Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps theyd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.', '\"What has been going on?\"', 'she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.', 'I think hes been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry.', 'He looked closer at Scabbers.', '\"No -- I dont believe it -- hes gone back to sleep-\" And so he had.', '\"Youve met Malfoy before?\"', 'Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.', '\"Ive heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly.', '\"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared.', 'Said theyd been bewitched.', 'My dad doesnt believe it.', 'He says Malfoys father didnt need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\"', 'He turned to Hermione.', '\"Can we help you with something?\"', '\"Youd better hurry up and put your robes on, Ive just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says were nearly there.', 'You havent been fighting, have you?', 'Youll be in trouble before we even get there!\"', '\"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her.', '\"Would you mind leaving while we change?\"', '\"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a sniffy voice.', '\"And youve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\"', 'Ron glared at her as she left.', 'Harry peered out of the window.', 'It was getting dark.', 'He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky.', 'The train did seem to be slowing down.', 'He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.', 'Rons were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.', 'A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes time.', 'Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\"', 'Harrys stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles.', 'They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.', 'The train slowed right down and finally stopped.', 'People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform.', 'Harry shivered in the cold night air.', 'Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs years!', 'Firs years over here!', 'All right there, Harry?\"', 'Hagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.', '\"Cmon, follow me -- any more firs years?', 'Mind yer step, now!', 'Firs years follow me!\"', 'Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path.', 'It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there.', 'Nobody spoke much.', 'Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.', '\"Ye all get yer firs sight o Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over his shoulder, \"jus round this bend here.\"', 'There was a loud \"Oooooh!\"', 'The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.', 'Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.', '\"No moren four to a boat!\"', 'Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore.', 'Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.', '\"Everyone in?\"', 'shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself.', '\"Right then -- FORWARD!\"', 'And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass.', 'Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead.', 'It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.', '\"Heads down!\"', 'yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face.', 'They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.', '\"Oy, you there!', 'Is this your toad?\"', 'said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.', '\"Trevor!\"', 'cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands.', 'Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrids lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.', 'They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak front door.', '\"Everyone here?', 'You there, still got yer toad?\"', 'Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.']\n",
      "[' The door swung open at once.', 'A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there.', 'She had a very stern face and Harrys first thought was that this was not someone to cross.', '\"The firs years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.', '\"Thank you, Hagrid.', 'I will take them from here.\"', 'She pulled the door wide.', 'The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys house in it.', 'The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.', 'They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.', 'Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall.', 'They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.', '\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses.', 'The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts.', 'You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.', '\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.', 'Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards.', 'While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points.', 'At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor.', 'I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.', '\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school.', 'I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\"', 'Her eyes lingered for a moment on Nevilles cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Rons smudged nose.', 'Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.', '\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"Please wait quietly.\"', 'She left the chamber.', 'Harry swallowed.', '\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\"', 'he asked Ron.', '\"Some sort of test, I think.', 'Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\"', 'Harrys heart gave a horrible jolt.', 'A test?', 'In front of the whole school?', 'But he didnt know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do?', 'He hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrived.', 'He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too.', 'No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed need.', 'Harry tried hard not to listen to her.', 'Hed never been more nervous, never, not even when hed had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue.', 'He kept his eyes fixed on the door.', 'Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.', 'Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.', '\"What the --?\"', 'He gasped.', 'So did the people around him.', 'About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall.', 'Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years.', 'They seemed to be arguing.', 'What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --\" \"My dear Friar, havent we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?', 'He gives us all a bad name and you know, hes not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?\"', 'A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.', 'Nobody answered.', '\"New students!\"', 'said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them.', '\"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\"', 'A few people nodded mutely.', '\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\"', 'said the Friar.', '\"My old house, you know.\"', '\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice.', '\"The Sorting Ceremonys about to start.\"', 'Professor McGonagall had returned.', 'One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.', '\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\"', 'Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.', 'Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place.', 'It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.', 'These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets.', 'At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.', 'Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.', 'The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight.', 'Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver.', 'Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars.', 'He heard Hermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside.', 'I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\"', 'It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didnt simply open on to the heavens.', 'Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years.', 'On top of the stool she put a pointed wizards hat.', 'This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty.', 'Aunt Petunia wouldnt have let it in the house.', 'Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too.', 'For a few seconds, there was complete silence.', 'Then the hat twitched.', 'A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think Im pretty, But dont judge on what you see, Ill eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.', 'You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For Im the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all.', 'Theres nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat cant see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.', 'You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if youve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin Youll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends.', 'So put me on!', 'Dont be afraid!', 'And dont get in a flap!', 'Youre in safe hands (though I have none) For Im a Thinking Cap!\"', 'The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song.', 'It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.', '\"So weve just got to try on the hat!\"', 'Ron whispered to Harry.', '\"Ill kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"', 'Harry.', 'smiled weakly.', 'Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching.', 'The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didnt feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment.', 'If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.', 'Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.', '\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said.', '\"Abbott, Hannah!\"', 'A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down.', 'A moments pause -- \"HUFFLEPUFF!\"', 'shouted the hat.', 'The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table.', 'Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.', '\"Bones, Susan!\"', '\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"', 'shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.', '\"Boot, Terry!\"', '\"RAVENCLAW!\"', 'The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. \"', 'Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Rons twin brothers catcalling.', '\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin.', 'Perhaps it was Harrys imagination, after all hed heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.', 'He was starting to feel definitely sick now.', 'He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.', 'He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.', '\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"', '\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"',

kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool.', 'The hat took a long time to decide with Neville.', 'When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing

tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of

that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump.', 'Then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that werent really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending.', 'It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot.', 'The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.', 'The ghosts didnt help, either.', 'It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open.', 'Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors

you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\"', 'Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch.', 'Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning.', 'Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor.', 'He wouldnt believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.',

one toe out of line, and shed whisk off for Filch, whod appear, wheezing, two seconds later.', 'Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins)

them, there were the classes themselves.', 'There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.', 'They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets.', 'Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.', 'Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost.', 'Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him.', 'Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.', 'Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk.', 'At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.', 'Professor McGonagall was again different.', 'Harry had been quite right to think she wasnt a teacher to cross.', 'Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.', '\"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said.', '\"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back.', 'You have been warned.\"', 'Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again.', 'They were all very impressed and couldnt wait to get started, but soon realized they werent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.', 'After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle.', 'By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.', 'The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke.', 'His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire hed met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days.', 'His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they werent sure they believed this story.', 'For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.', 'Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone else.', 'Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadnt had any idea that they were witches and wizards.', 'There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didnt have much of a head start.', 'Friday was an important day for Harry

us, \" said Harry.', 'Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.', 'Just then, the mail arrived.', 'Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.', 'Hedwig hadnt brought Harry anything so far.', 'She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls.', 'This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harrys plate.', 'Harry tore it open at once.', 'It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?', 'I want to hear all about your first week.', 'Send us an answer back with Hedwig.', 'Hagrid Harry borrowed Rons quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.', 'It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.', 'At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him.', 'By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew hed been wrong.', 'Snape didnt dislike Harry -- he hated him.', 'Potions lessons took place down in one of the

every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort.', '\"As there is little foolish

of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses....', 'I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you arent as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\"', 'More silence followed this little speech.', 'Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows.', 'Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked

of what to an infusion of what?', 'Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermiones hand had shot into the air.', '\"I dont know, sit,\" said Harry.', 'Snapes lips curled into a sneer.', '\"Tut, tut -- fame clearly isnt everything.\"', 'He ignored Hermiones hand.', '\"Lets try again.', 'Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\"', 'Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.', 'He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.', '\"I dont know, sit.\"', '\"Thought you wouldnt open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\"', 'Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes.', 'He had looked through his books at the Dursleys, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?', 'Snape was still ignoring Hermiones quivering hand.', '\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"', 'At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.', '\"I dont know,\" said Harry quietly.', '\"I think Hermione does, though, why dont you try her?\"', 'A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamuss eye, and Seamus winked.', 'Snape, however, was not pleased.', '\"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione.', '\"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death.', 'A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.', 'As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.', 'Well?', 'Why arent you all copying that down?\"', 'There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment.', 'Over the noise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\"', 'Things didnt improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued.', 'Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.', 'He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like.', 'He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon.', 'Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamuss cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in peoples shoes.', 'Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.', '\"Idiot boy!\"', 'snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand.', '\"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\"', 'Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.', '\"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus.', 'Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.', '\"You -- Potter -- why didnt you tell him not to add the quills?', 'Thought hed make you look good if he got it wrong, did you?', 'Thats another point youve lost for Gryffindor.\"', 'This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.', '\"Doi* push it,\" he muttered, \"Ive heard Snape can turn very nasty.\"', 'As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harrys mind was racing and his spirits were low.', 'Hed lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much?', '\"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snapes always taking points off Fred and George.', 'Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\"', 'At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds.', 'Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest.', 'A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.', 'When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks.', 'Then Hagrids voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang -- back.\"', 'Hagrids big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.', '\"Hang on,\" he said.', '\"Back, Fang.\"', 'He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.', 'There was only one room inside.', 'Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.', '\"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears.', 'Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.', '\"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.', '\"Another Weasley, eh?\"', 'said Hagrid, glancing at Rons freckles.', 'I spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forest.\"', 'The rock

eyes this time.', 'He grunted and offered him another rock cake.', 'Harry read the story again.', 'The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day.', 'Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package.', 'Had that been what the thieves were looking for?', 'As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid.', 'Had Hagrid collected that package just in time?', 'Where was it now?', 'And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didnt want to tell Harry?']\n",
      "[' Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy.', 'Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didnt have to put up with Malfoy much.', 'Or at least, they didnt until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.', 'Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.', '\"Typical,\" said Harry darkly.', '\"Just what I always wanted.', 'To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\"', 'He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.', '\"You dont know that youll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably.', '\"Anyway, I know Malfoys always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet thats all talk.\"', 'Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot.', 'He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters.', 'He wasnt the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, hed spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick.', 'Even Ron would tell anyone whod listen about the time hed almost hit a hang glider on Charlies old broom.', 'Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.', 'Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer.', 'Ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.', 'Harry had caught Ron prodding Deans poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.', 'Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one.', 'Privately, Harry felt shed had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.', 'Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was.', 'This was something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadnt tried.', 'At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages.', 'Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermiones lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.', 'Harry hadnt had a single letter since Hagrids note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course.', 'Malfoys eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.', 'A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother.', 'He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.', '\"Its a Remembrall!\"', 'he explained.', '\"Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if theres something youve forgotten to do.', 'Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh...\" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \"Youve forgotten something...\" Neville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.', 'Harry and Ron jumped to their feet.', 'They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.', '\"Whats going on?\"', '\"Malfoys got my Remembrall, Professor.\"', 'Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.', '\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.', 'At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson.', 'It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.', 'The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground.', 'Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.', 'Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived.', 'She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.', '\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\"', 'she barked.', '\"Everyone stand by a broomstick.', 'Come on, hurry up.\"', 'Harry glanced down at his broom.', 'It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.', '\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say Up!\"', '\"UPF everyone shouted.', 'Harrys broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did.', 'Hermione Grangers had simply rolled over on the ground, and Nevilles hadnt moved at all.', 'Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.', 'Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.', 'Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy hed been doing it wrong for years.', '\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch.', '\"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly.', 'On my whistle -- three -- two --\" But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hoochs lips.', '\"Come back, boy!\"', 'she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet.', 'Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and -- WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap.', 'His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.', 'Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.', '\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter.', '\"Come on, boy -- its all right, up you get.\".', 'She turned to the rest of the class.', '\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing!', 'You leave those brooms where they are or youll be out of Hogwarts before you can say Quidditch.', 'Come on, dear.\"', 'Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.', 'No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.', '\"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"', 'The other Slytherins joined in.', '\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.', '\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\"', 'said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl.', '\"Never thought youd like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\"', '\"Look!\"', 'said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass.', '\"Its that stupid thing Longbottoms gran sent him.\"', 'The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.', '\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly.', 'Everyone stopped talking to watch.', 'Malfoy smiled nastily.', '\"I think Ill leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?\"', '\"Give it here!\"', 'Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off.', 'He hadnt been lying, he could fly well.', 'Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\"', 'Harry grabbed his broom.', '\"No!\"', 'shouted Hermione Granger.', '\"Madam Hooch told us not to move -- youll get us all into trouble.\"', 'Harry ignored her.', 'Blood was pounding in his ears.', 'He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful.', 'He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.', 'He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair.', 'Malfoy looked stunned.', '\"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or Ill knock you off that broom!\"', '\"Oh, yeah?\"', 'said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.', 'Harry knew, somehow, what to do.', 'He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin.', 'Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady.', 'A few people below were clapping.', '\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.', 'The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.', '\"Catch it if you can, then!\"', 'he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.', 'Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall.', 'He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.', '\"HARRY POTTER!\"', 'His heart sank faster than hed just dived.', 'Professor McGonagall was running toward them.', 'He got to his feet, trembling.', '\"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --\" Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \"-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --\" \"It wasnt his fault, Professor --\" \"Be quiet, Miss Patil \"But Malfoy --\" \"Thats enough, Mr. Weasley.', 'Potter, follow me, now.\"', 'Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyles triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagalls wake as she strode toward the castle.', 'He was going to be expelled, he just knew it.', 'He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice.', 'Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up.', 'Now hed done it.', 'He hadnt even lasted two weeks.', 'Hed be packing his bags in ten minutes.', 'What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?', 'Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didnt say a word to him.', 'She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her.', 'Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore.', 'He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper.', 'Perhaps he could be Hagrids assistant.', 'His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrids bag.', 'Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom.', 'She opened the door and poked her head inside.', '\"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\"', 'Wood?', 'thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?', 'But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwicles class looking confused.', '\"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.', '\"In here.\"', 'Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.', '\"Out, Peeves!\"', 'she barked.', 'Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing.', 'Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.', '\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood.', 'Wood -- Ive found you a Seeker.\"', 'Woods expression changed from puzzlement to delight.', '\"Are you serious, Professor?\"', '\"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply.', '\"The boys a natural.', 'Ive never seen anything like it.', 'Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\"', 'Harry nodded silently.', 'He didnt have a clue what was going on, but he didnt seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.', '\"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood.', '\"Didnt even scratch himself.', 'Charlie Weasley couldnt have done it.\"', 'Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.', '\"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\"', 'he asked excitedly.', '\"Woods captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained.', '\"Hes just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him.', '\"Light -- speedy -- well have to get him a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, Id say.\"', 'I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we cant bend the first-year rule.', 'Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.', 'Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldnt look Severus Snape in the face for weeks....\" Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.', '\"I want to hear youre training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\"', 'Then she suddenly smiled.', '\"Your father would have been proud,\" she said.', '\"He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\"', '\"Youre joking.\"', 'It was dinnertime.', 'Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when hed left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.', 'Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but hed forgotten all about it.', '\"Seeker?\"', 'he said.', '\"But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth.', 'He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon.', '\"Wood told me.\"', 'Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.', '\"I start training next week,\" said Harry.', '\"Only dont tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\"', 'Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.', '\"Well done,\" said George in a low voice.', '\"Wood told us.', 'Were on the team too -- Beaters.\"', '\"I tell you, were going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\" said Fred.', '\"We havent won since Charlie left, but this years team is going to be brilliant.', 'You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\"', '\"Anyway, weve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons hes found a new secret passageway out of the school.\"', '\"Bet its that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week.', 'See you.\"', 'Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.', '\"Having a last meal, Potter?', 'When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\"', '\"Youre a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got your little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly.', 'There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.', '\"Id take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy.', '\"Tonight, if you want.', 'Wizards duel.', 'Wands only -- no contact.', 'Whats the matter?', 'Never heard of a wizards duel before, I suppose?\"', '\"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around.', '\"Im his second, whos yours?\"', 'Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.', '\"Crabbe,\" he said.', '\"Midnight all right?', 'Well meet you in the trophy room; thats always unlocked.\"', 'When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.', '\"What is a wizards duel?\"', 'said Harry.', '\"And what do you mean, youre my second?\"', '\"Well, a seconds there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie.', 'Catching the look on Harrys face, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards.', 'The most you and Malfoyll be able to do is send sparks at each other.', 'Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage.', 'I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\"', '\"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\"', '\"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested.', '\"Excuse me.\"', 'They both looked up.', 'It was Hermione Granger.', '\"Cant a person eat in peace in this place?\"', 'said Ron.', 'Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.', '\"I couldnt help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --\" \"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered. \"', '--and you mustnt go wandering around the school at night, think of the points youll lose Gryffindor if youre caught, and youre bound to be.', 'Its really very selfish of you.\"', '\"And its really none of your business,\" said Harry.', '\"Good-bye,\" said Ron.', 'All the same, it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasnt back from the hospital wing).', 'Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you, youd better dodge it, because I cant remember how to block them.\"', 'There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today.', 'On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face.', 'He couldnt miss it.', '\"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"wed better go.\"', 'They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room.', 'A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows.', 'They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I cant believe youre going to do this, Harry.\"', 'A lamp flickered on.', 'It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.', '\"You!\"', 'said Ron furiously.', '\"Go back to bed!\"', '\"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy -- hes a prefect, hed put a stop to this.\"', 'Harry couldnt believe anyone could be so interfering.', '\"Come on,\" he said to Ron.', 'He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.', 'Hermione wasnt going to give up that easily.', 'She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.', '\"Dont you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I dont want Slytherin to win the house cup, and youll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\"', '\"Go away.\"', '\"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when youre on the train home tomorrow, youre so --\" But what they were, they didnt find out.', 'Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting.', 'The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.', '\"Now what am I going to do?\"', 'she asked shrilly.', '\"Thats your problem,\" said Ron.', '\"Weve got to go, we 3 re going to be late.\"', 'They hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.', '\"Im coming with you,\" she said.', '\"You are not.\"', '\"Dyou think Im going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?', 'If he finds all three of us Ill tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\"', '\"Youve got some nerve --\" said Ron loudly.', '\"Shut up, both of you!\"', 'said Harry sharply.', 'I heard something.\"', 'It was a sort of snuffling.', '\"Mrs.', 'Norris?\"', 'breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.', 'It wasnt Mrs. Norris.', 'It was Neville.', 'He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.', '\"Thank goodness you found me!', 'Ive been out here for hours, I couldnt remember the new password to get in to bed.\"', '\"Keep your voice down, Neville.', 'The passwords Pig snout but it wont help you now, the Fat Ladys gone off somewhere.\"', '\"Hows your arm?\"', 'said Harry.', '\"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them.', '\"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\"', '\"Good - well, look, Neville, weve got to be somewhere, well see you later --\" \"Dont leave me!\"', 'said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I dont want to stay here alone, the Bloody Barons been past twice already.\"', 'Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.', '\"If either of you get us caught, Ill never rest until Ive learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.', 'Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.', 'They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows.', 'At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky.', 'They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.', 'Malfoy and Crabbe werent there yet.', 'The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them.', 'Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness.', 'They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room.', 'Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once.', 'The minutes crept by.', '\"Hes late, maybe hes chickened out,\" Ron whispered.', 'Then a noise in the next room made them jump.', 'Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasnt Malfoy.', '\"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\"', 'It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris.', 'Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filchs voice.', 'Nevilles robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.', '\"Theyre in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\"', '\"This way!\"', 'Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor.', 'They could hear Filch getting nearer.', 'Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.', 'The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.', '\"RUN!\"', 'Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.', '\"I think weve lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead.', 'Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.', 'I -- told -you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \"I -- told -- you.\"', '\"Weve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as possible.\"', '\"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry.', '\"You realize that, dont you?', 'He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\"', 'Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasnt going to tell her that.', '\"Lets go.\"', 'It wasnt going to be that simple.', 'They hadnt gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.', 'It was Peeves.', 'He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.', '\"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- youll get us thrown out.\"', 'Peeves cackled.', '\"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties?', 'Tut, tut, tut.', 'Naughty, naughty, youll get caughty.\"', '\"Not if you dont give us away, Peeves, please.\"', '\"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly.', '\"Its for your own good, you know.\"', '\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.', '\"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\"', 'Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR\" Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.', '\"This is it!\"', 'Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"Were done for!', 'This is the end!\"', 'They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peevess shouts.', '\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled.', 'She grabbed Harrys wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, Alohomora!\"', 'The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.', '\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\"', 'Filch was saying.', '\"Quick, tell me.\"', '\"Say please.\"', '\"Dont mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\"', '\"Shant say nothing if you dont say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.', '\"All right -please.\"', '\"NOTHING!', 'Ha haaa!', 'Told you I wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say please!', 'Ha ha!', 'Haaaaaa!\"', 'And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.', '\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered.', '\"I think well be okay -- get off, Neville!\"', 'For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harrys bathrobe for the last minute.', '\"What?\"', 'Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what.', 'For a moment, he was sure hed walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.', 'They werent in a room, as he had supposed.', 'They were in a corridor.', 'The forbidden corridor on the third floor.', 'And now they knew why it was forbidden.', 'They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.', 'It had three heads.', 'Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.', 'It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.', 'Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, hed take Filch.', 'They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor.', 'Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didnt see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster.', 'They didnt stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.', '\"Where on earth have you all been?\"', 'she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.', '\"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward.', 'They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.', 'It was a while before any of them said anything.', 'Neville, indeed, looked as if hed never speak again.', '\"What do they think theyre doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\"', 'said Ron finally.', '\"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\"', 'Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.', '\"You dont use your eyes, any of you, do you?\"', 'she snapped.', '\"Didnt you see what it was standing on.', '\"The floor?\"', 'Harry suggested.', '\"I wasnt looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\"', '\"No, not the floor.', 'It was standing on a trapdoor.', 'Its obviously guarding something.\"', 'She stood up, glaring at them.', 'I hope youre pleased with yourselves.', 'We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled.', 'Now, if you dont mind, Im going to bed.\"', 'Ron stared after her, his mouth open.', '\"No, we dont mind,\" he said.', '\"Youd think we dragged her along, wouldnt you.', 'But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed.', 'The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said?', 'Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.', 'It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.']\n",
      "[' Malfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.', 'Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one.', 'In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.', '\"Its either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron.', '\"Or both,\" said Harry.', 'But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didnt have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.', 'Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor.', 'All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.', 'Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.', 'All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.', 'As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyones attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.', 'Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor.', 'They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.', 'Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN

found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle.', 'Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.', '\"Thats a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face.', '\"Youll be in for it this time, Potter, first years arent allowed them.\"', 'Ron couldnt resist it.', '\"Its not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"its a Nimbus Two Thousand.', 'What did you say youve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\"', 'Ron grinned at Harry.', '\"Comets look flashy, but theyre not in the same league as the Nimbus.\"', '\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldnt afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back.', '\"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\"', 'Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoys elbow.', '\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\"', 'he squeaked.', '\"Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.', '\"Yes, yes, thats right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.', '\"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter.', 'And what model is it?\"', '\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoys face.', '\"And its really thanks to Malfoy here that Ive got it,\" he added.', 'Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoys obvious rage and confusion.', '\"Well, its true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadnt stolen Nevilles Remembrall I woulnt be on the team....\" \"So I suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules?\"', 'came an angry voice from just behind them.', 'Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harrys hand.', '\"I thought you werent speaking to us?\"', 'said Harry.', '\"Yes, dont stop now,\" said Ron, \"its doing us so much good.\"', 'Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.', 'Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day.', 'It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where hed be learning to play that night.', 'He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.', '\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harrys bedspread.', 'Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful.', 'Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.', 'As seven oclock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field.', 'Held never been inside the stadium before.', 'Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on.', 'At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.', 'They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.', 'Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground.', 'What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field.', 'The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.', '\"Hey, Potter, come down!', 'Oliver Wood had arrived.', 'fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm.', 'Harry landed next to him.', '\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting.', '\"I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural.', 'Im just going to teach you the rules this evening, then youll be joining team practice three times a week.\"', 'He opened the crate.', 'Inside were four different-sized balls.', '\"Right,\" said Wood.', '\"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if its not too easy to play.', 'There are seven players on each side.', 'Three of them are called Chasers.\"', '\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.', '\"This balls called the Quaffle,\" said Wood.', '\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.', 'Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops.', 'Follow me?\"', '\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" Harry recited.', '\"So -- thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isnt it?\"', '\"Whats basketball?\"', 'said Wood curiously.', '\"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly.', '\"Now, theres another player on each side whos called the Keeper -Im Keeper for Gryffindor.', 'I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\"', '\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all.', '\"And they play with the Quaffle.', 'Okay, got that.', 'So what are they for?\"', 'He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.', '\"Ill show you now,\" said Wood.', '\"Take this.\"', 'He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.', '\"Im going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said.', '\"These two are the Bludgers.\"', 'He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle.', 'Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.', '\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry.', 'He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.', 'At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harrys face.', 'Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.', '\"See?\"', 'Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely.', '\"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms.', 'Thats why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- its their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team.', 'So -- think youve got all that?\"', '\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off.', '\"Very good,\" said Wood.', '\"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\"', 'Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.', '\"Never at Hogwarts.', 'Weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that.', 'Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker.', 'Thats you.', 'And you dont have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open.\"', '\"Dont worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, theyre like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"', 'Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.', 'Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut.', 'It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.', '\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and its the most important ball of the lot.', 'Its very hard to catch because its so fast and difficult to see.', 'Its the Seekers job to catch it.', 'Youve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other teams Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win.', 'Thats why Seekers get fouled so much.', 'A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.', '\"Well, thats it -- any questions?\"', 'Harry shook his head.', 'He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem.', '\"We wont practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"its too dark, we might lose it.', 'Lets try you out with a few of these.\"', 'He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.', 'Harry didnt miss a single one, and Wood was delighted.', 'After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldnt carry on.', '\"That Quidditch cupll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle.', '\"I wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadnt gone off chasing dragons.\"', 'Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that hed already been at Hogwarts two months.', 'The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had.', 'His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.', 'On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors.', 'Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make Nevilles toad zoom around the classroom.', 'Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice.', 'Harrys partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye).', 'Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger.', 'It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this.', 'She hadnt spoken to either of them since the day Harrys broomstick had arrived.', '\"Now, dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicing!\"', 'squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual.', '\"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick.', 'And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\"', 'It was very difficult.', 'Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.', 'Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.', 'Ron, at the next table, wasnt having much more luck.', '\"Wingardium Leviosa!\"', 'he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.', '\"Youre saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap.', '\"Its Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the gar nice and long.\"', '\"You do it, then, if youre so clever,\" Ron snarled.', 'Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"', 'Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.', '\"Oh, well done!\"', 'cried Professor Flitwick, clapping.', '\"Everyone see here, Miss Grangers done it!\"', 'Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.', '\"Its no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"shes a nightmare, honestly.', '‚Äú Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him.', 'It was Hermione.', 'Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.', '\"I think she heard you.\"', '\"So?\"', 'said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable.', '\"She mustve noticed shes got no friends.\"', 'Hermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all afternoon.', 'On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone.', 'Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.', 'A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.', 'The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.', 'Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.', 'Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledores chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know.\"', 'He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.', 'There was an uproar.', 'It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledores wand to bring silence.', '\"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\"', 'Percy was in his element.', '\"Follow me!', 'Stick together, first years!', 'No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders!', 'Stay close behind me, now.', 'Make way, first years coming through!', 'Excuse me, Im a prefect!\"', '\"How could a troll get in?\"', 'Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.', '\"Dont ask me, theyre supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron.', '\"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"', 'They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.', 'As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Rons arm.', '\"Ive just thought -- Hermione.\"', '\"What about her?\"', '\"She doesnt know about the troll.\"', 'Ron bit his lip.', '\"Oh, all right,\" he snapped.', '\"But Percyd better not see us.\"', 'Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls bathroom.', 'They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.', '\"Percy!\"', 'hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.', 'Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape.', 'He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.', '\"Whats he doing?\"', 'Harry whispered.', '\"Why isnt he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\"', '\"Search me.\"', 'Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snapes fading footsteps.', '\"Hes heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.', '\"Can you smell something?\"', 'Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.', 'And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet.', 'Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them.', 'They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.', 'It was a horrible sight.', 'Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut.', 'It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet.', 'The smell coming from it was incredible.', 'It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.', 'The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.', 'It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.', '\"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered.', '\"We could lock it in.\"', '\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.', 'They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasnt about to come out of it.', 'With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.', 'Yes!\"', 'Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber theyd just chained up.', '\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.', '\"Its the girls bathroom!\"', 'Harry gasped.', '\"Hermione!\"', 'they said together.', 'It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?', 'Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic.', 'Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.', 'Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint.', 'The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.', '\"Confuse it!\"', 'Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.', 'The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.', 'It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise.', 'Its mean little eyes saw Harry.', 'It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.', '\"Oy, pea-brain!\"', 'yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it.', 'The troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.', '\"Come on, run, run!\"', 'Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldnt move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.', 'The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk.', 'It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.', 'Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck from behind.', 'The troll couldnt feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the trolls nostrils.', 'Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.', 'Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"', 'The club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owners head.', 'The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.', 'Harry got to his feet.', 'He was shaking and out of breath.', 'Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.', 'It was Hermione who spoke first.', '\"Is it -- dead?\"', 'I dont think so,\" said Harry, I think its just been knocked out.\"', 'He bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose.', 'It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.', '\"Urgh -- troll boogers.\"', 'He wiped it on the trolls trousers.', 'A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.', 'They hadnt realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars.', 'A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear.', 'Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.', 'Snape bent over the troll.', 'Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry.', 'Harry had never seen her look so angry.', 'Her lips were white.', 'Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harrys mind.', '\"What on earth were you thinking of?\"', 'said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice.', 'Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air.', '\"Youre lucky you werent killed.', 'Why arent you in your dormitory?\"', 'Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look.', 'Harry looked at the floor.', 'He wished Ron would put his wand down.', 'Then a small voice came out of the shadows.', '\"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me.\"', '\"Miss Granger!\"', 'Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.', 'I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because Ive read all about them.\"', 'Ron dropped his wand.', 'Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?', '\"If they hadnt found me, Id be dead now.', 'Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club.', 'They didnt have time to come and fetch anyone.', 'It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\"', 'Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to them.', '\"Well -- in that case...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\"', 'Hermione hung her head.', 'Harry was speechless.', 'Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble.', 'It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.', '\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall.', '\"Im very disappointed in you.', 'If youre not hurt at all, youd better get off to Gryffindor tower.', 'Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\"', 'Hermione left.', 'Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.', '\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll.', 'You each win Gryffindor five points.', 'Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this.', 'You may go.\"', 'They hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up.', 'It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.', '\"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled.', '\"Five, you mean, once shes taken off Hermiones.\"', '\"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted.', '\"Mind you, we did save her.\"', '\"She might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with her,\" Harry reminded him.', 'They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.', '\"Pig snout,\" they said and entered.', 'The common room was packed and noisy.', 'Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up.', 'Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them.', 'There was a very embarrassed pause.', 'Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.', 'But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend.', 'There are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.']\n",

Quidditch season had begun.', 'On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin.', 'If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.', 'Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret.', 'But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didnt know which was worse -- people telling him hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.', 'It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend.', 'He didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do.', 'She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.', 'Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.', 'Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.', 'The day before Harrys first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.', 'They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard.', 'Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping.', 'Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldnt be allowed.', 'Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snapes eye.',

air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.', '\"Budge up there, move along.\"', '\"Hagrid!\"', 'Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.', '\"Bin watchin from me hut,\" said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \"But it isnt the same as bein in the crowd.', 'No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\"', '\"Nope,\" said Ron.', '\"Harry hasnt had much to do yet.\"', '\"Kept outta trouble, though, thats somethin,\" said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.', 'Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch.', 'This was part of his and Woods game plan.', '\"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had said.', '\"We dont want you attacked before you have to be.\"', 'When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings.', 'Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch.', 'Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.', '\"All right there, Harry?\"', 'he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.', '\"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?\"', 'A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.', 'Harry saw it.', 'In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold.', 'Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too.', 'Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.', 'Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed -- WHAM!', 'A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harrys broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.', '\"Foul!\"', 'screamed the Gryffindors.', 'Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor.', 'But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.', 'Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref!', 'Red card!\"', '\"What are you talking about, Dean?\"', 'said Ron.', '\"Red card!\"', 'said Dean furiously.', '\"In soccer you get shown the red card and youre out of the game!\"', '\"But this isnt soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him.', 'Hagrid, however, was on Deans side.', '\"They oughta change the rules.', 'Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\"', 'Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.', '\"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating \"Jordan!\"', 'growled Professor McGonagall.', '\"I mean, after that open and revolting foul Jordan, Im warning you --\" \"All right, all right.', 'Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, Im sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\"', 'It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened.', 'His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch.', 'For a split second, he thought he was going to fall.', 'He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees.', 'Hed never felt anything like that.', 'It happened again.', 'It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off.', 'But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off.', 'Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts -- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control.', 'He couldnt turn it.', 'He couldnt direct it at all.', 'It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.', 'Lee was still commentating.', '\"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet -- passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose -- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...', 'The Slytherins were cheering.', 'No one seemed to have noticed that Harrys broom was behaving strangely.', 'It was carrying- him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.', '\"Dunno what Harry thinks hes doing,\" Hagrid mumbled.', 'He stared through his binoculars.', '\"If I didn know better, Id say hed lost control of his broom... but he cant have....\" Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands.', 'His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on.', 'Then the whole crowd gasped.', 'Harrys broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it.', 'He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.', '\"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\"', 'Seamus whispered.', '\"Cant have,\" Hagrid said, his voice shaking.', '\"Cant nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\"', 'At these words, Hermione seized Hagrids binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.', '\"What are you doing?\"', 'moaned Ron, gray-faced.', '\"I knew it,\" Hermione gasped, \"Snape -- look.\"', 'Ron grabbed the binoculars.', 'Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them.', 'He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.', '\"Hes doing something -- jinxing the broom,\" said Hermione.', '\"What should we do?\"', '\"Leave it to me.\"', 'Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared.', 'Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry.', 'His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer.', 'The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still.', 'They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.', 'Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.', '\"Come on, Hermione,\" Ron muttered desperately.', 'Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didnt even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.', 'Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well- chosen words.', 'Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snapes robes.', 'It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.', 'A sudden yelp told her she had done her job.', 'Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row -- Snape would never know what had happened.', 'It was enough.', 'Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.', '\"Neville, you can look!\"', 'Ron said.', 'Neville had been sobbing into Hagrids jacket for the last five minutes.', 'Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.', '\"Ive got the Snitch!\"', 'he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.', '\"He didnt catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadnt broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results -- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty.', 'Harry heard none of this, though.', 'He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrids hut, with Ron and Hermione.', '\"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him.', 'He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldnt take his eyes off you.\"', '\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands.', '\"Why would Snape do somethin like that?\"', 'Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him.', 'Harry decided on the truth.', '\"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid.', '\"He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween.', 'It bit him.', 'We think he was trying to steal whatever its guarding.\"', 'Hagrid dropped the teapot.', '\"How do you know about Fluffy?\"', 'he said.', '\"Fluffy?\"', '\"Yeah -- hes mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the \"Yes?\"', 'said Harry eagerly.', '\"Now, dont ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly.', '\"Thats top secret, that is.\"', '\"But Snapes trying to steal it.\"', '\"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid again.', '\"Snapes a Hogwarts teacher, hed do nothin of the sort.\"', '\"So why did he just try and kill Harry?\"', 'cried Hermione.', 'The afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.', 'I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, Ive read all about them!', 'Youve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasnt blinking at all, I saw him!\"', '\"Im tellin yeh, yer wrong!\"', 'said Hagrid hotly.', '\"I don know why Harrys broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn try an kill a student!', 'Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh.', 'Its dangerous.', 'You forget that dog, an you forget what its guardin, thats between Professor Dumbledore an Nicolas Flamel --\" \"Aha!\"', 'said Harry, \"so theres someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\"', 'Hagrid looked furious with himself.']\n"

several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban.', 'The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.', 'No one could wait for the holidays to start.', 'While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.', 'Worst of all were Professor Snapes classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.', '\"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because theyre not wanted at home.\"', 'He was looking over at Harry as he spoke.', 'Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.', 'Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them.', 'Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match.', 'Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next.', 'Then hed realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick.', 'So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.', 'It was true that Harry wasnt going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.', 'Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once.', 'He didnt feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas hed ever had.', 'Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.', 'When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead.', 'Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.', '\"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\"', 'Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.', '\"Nah, Im all right, thanks, Ron.\"', '\"Would you mind moving out of the way?\"', 'came Malfoys cold drawl from behind them.', '\"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley?', 'Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut of Hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used to.\"', 'Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.', '\"WEASLEY!\"', 'Ron let go of the front of Malfoys robes.', '\"He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree.', '\"Malfoy was insultin his family.\"', '\"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said Snape silkily.', '\"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isnt more.', 'Move along, all of you.\"', 'Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.', '\"Ill get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoys back, \"one of these days, Ill get him --\" \"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\"', '\"Come on, cheer up, its nearly Christmas,\" said Hagrid.', '\"Tell yeh what, come with me an see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\"', 'So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.', '\"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?\"', 'The hall looked spectacular.', 'Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.', '\"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\"', 'Hagrid asked.', '\"Just one,\" said Hermione.', '\"And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, weve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\"', '\"Oh yeah, youre right,\" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.', '\"The library?\"', 'said Hagrid, following them out of the hall.', '\"Just before the holidays?', 'Bit keen, arent yeh?\"', '\"Oh, were not working,\" Harry told him brightly.', '\"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel weve been trying to find out who he is.\"', '\"You what?\"', 'Hagrid looked shocked.', '\"Listen here -- Ive told yeh -- drop it.', 'Its nothin to you what that dogs guardin.\"', '\"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, thats all,\" said Hermione.', '\"Unless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble?\"', 'Harry added.', '\"We mustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know Ive read his name somewhere.\"', '\"Im sayin nothin, said Hagrid flatly.', '\"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.', 'They had indeed been searching books for Flamels name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?', 'The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book.', 'He wasnt in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry.', 'And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.', 'Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random.', 'Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section.', 'He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasnt somewhere in there.', 'Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew hed never get one.', 'These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.', '\"What are you looking for, boy?\"', '\"Nothing,\" said Harry.', 'Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.', '\"Youd better get out, then.', 'Go on -- out!\"', 'Wishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library.', 'He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel.', 'They were sure shed be able to tell them, but they couldnt risk Snape hearing what they were up to.', 'Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasnt very hopeful.', 'They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt surprising theyd found nothing.', 'What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.', 'Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.', 'They went off to lunch.', '\"You will keep looking while Im away, wont you?\"', 'said Hermione.', '\"And send me an owl if you find anything.\"', '\"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron.', '\"Itd be safe to ask them.\"', '\"Very safe, as theyre both dentists,\" said Hermione.', 'Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.', 'They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire.', 'They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnt work.', 'Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess.', 'This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle.', 'Rons set was very old and battered.', 'Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather.', 'However, old chessmen werent a drawback at all.', 'Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.', 'Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didnt trust him at all.', 'He wasnt a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing.', '\"Dont send me there, cant you see his knight?', 'Send him, we can afford to lose him.\"', 'On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all.', 'When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.', '\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.', '\"You, too,\" said Harry.', '\"Will you look at this?', 'Ive got some presents!\"', '\"What did you expect, turnips?\"', 'said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harrys.', 'Harry picked up the top parcel.', 'It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid.', 'Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute.', 'Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself.', 'Harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl.', 'A second, very small parcel contained a note.', 'We received your message and enclose your Christmas present.', 'From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.', 'Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.', '\"Thats friendly,\" said Harry.', 'Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.', '\"Weird!\"', 'he said, NMat a shape!', 'This is money?\"', '\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was.', '\"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?\"', '\"I think I know who that ones from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel.', '\"My mom.', 'I told her you didnt expect any presents and -- oh, no,\" he groaned, \"shes made you a Weasley sweater.\"', 'Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.', '\"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and mines always maroon.\"', '\"Thats really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.', 'His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.', 'This only left one parcel.', 'Harry picked it up and felt it.', 'It was very light.', 'He unwrapped it.', 'Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds.', 'Ron gasped.', '\"Ive heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans hed gotten from Hermione.', '\"If thats what I think it is -- theyre really rare, and really valuable.\"', '\"What is it?\"', 'Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor.', 'It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.', '\"Its an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face.', '\"Im sure it is -- try it on.\"', 'Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.', '\"It is!', 'Look down!\"', 'Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone.', 'He dashed to the mirror.', 'Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible.', 'He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.', '\"Theres a note!\"', 'said Ron suddenly.', '\"A note fell out of it!\"', 'Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter.', 'Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died.', 'It is time it was returned to you.', 'Use it well.', 'A Very Merry Christmas to you.', 'There was no signature.', 'Harry stared at the note.', 'Ron was admiring the cloak.', '\"Id give anything for one of these,\" he said.', '\"Anything.', 'Whats the matter?\"', '\"Nothing,\" said Harry.', 'He felt very strange.', 'Who had sent the cloak?', 'Had it really once belonged to his father?', 'Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in.', 'Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight.', 'He didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.', '\"Merry Christmas!\"', '\"Hey, look -- Harrys got a Weasley sweater, too!\"', 'Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. \"Harrys is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harrys sweater.', '\"She obviously makes more of an effort if youre not family.\"', '\"Why arent you wearing yours, Ron?\"', 'George demanded.', '\"Come on, get it on, theyre lovely and warm.\"', '\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.', '\"You havent got a letter on yours,\" George observed.', '\"I suppose she thinks you dont forget your name.', 'But were not stupid -- we know were called Gred and Forge.\"', '\"Whats all th is noise.', 'Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving.', 'He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.', '\"P for prefect!', 'Get it on, Percy, come on, were all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\"', '\"I -- dont -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.', '\"And youre not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George.', '\"Christmas is a time for family.\"', 'They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.', 'Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner.', 'A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table.', 'These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.', 'Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didnt just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live, white mice.', 'Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.', 'Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey.', 'Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice.', 'Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harrys amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.', 'When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.', 'The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norriss Christmas dinner.', 'Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds.', 'Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron.', 'He suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if Percy hadnt tried to help him so much.', 'After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect badge.', 'It had been Harrys best Christmas day ever.', 'Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day.', 'Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.', 'Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his four-poster.', 'Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.', 'His fathers... this had been his fathers.', 'He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air.', 'Use it well, the note had said.', 'He had to try it, now.', 'He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself.', 'Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.', 'It was a very funny feeling.', 'Use it well.', 'Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake.', 'The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak.', 'Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence.', 'He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.', 'Ron grunted in his sleep.', 'Should Harry wake him?', 'Something held him back -- his fathers cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone.', 'He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.', '\"Whos there?\"', 'squawked the Fat Lady.', 'Harry said nothing.', 'He walked quickly down the corridor.', 'Where should he go?', 'He stopped, his heart racing, and thought.', 'And then it came to him.', 'The Restricted Section in the library.', 'Hed be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.', 'He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.', 'The library was pitch-black and very eerie.', 'Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books.', 'The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.', 'The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library.', 'Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.', 'They didnt tell him much.', 'Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldnt understand.', 'Some had no title at all.', 'One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood.', 'The hairs on the back of Harrys neck prickled.', 'Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldnt be.', 'He had to start somewhere.', 'Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book.', 'A large black and silver volume caught his eye.', 'He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.', 'A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming!', 'Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note.', 'He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once.', 'Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it.', 'He passed Filch in the doorway; Filchs pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the books shrieks still ringing in his ears.', 'He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor.', 'He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadnt paid attention to where he was going.', 'Perhaps because it was dark, he didnt recognize where he was at all.', 'There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.', '\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebodys been in the library Restricted Section.\"', 'Harry felt the blood drain out of his face.', 'Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section?', 'Well, they cant be far, well catch them.\"', 'Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead.', 'They couldnt see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him -- the cloak didnt stop him from being solid.', 'He backed away as quietly as he could.', 'A door stood ajar to his left.', 'It was his only hope.', 'He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything.', 'They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away.', 'That had been close, very close.', 'It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.', 'It looked like an unused classroom.', 'The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didnt look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.', 'It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet.', 'There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.', 'His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again.', 'He stepped in front of it.', 'He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming.', 'He whirled around.', 'His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.', 'But the room was empty.', 'Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.', 'There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others.', 'Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there.', 'Or were they all invisible, too?', 'Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?', 'He looked in the mirror again.', 'A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving.', 'He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him.', 'If she was really there, hed touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror.', 'She was a very pretty woman.', 'She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass.', 'Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time.', 'The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her.', 'He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy.', 'It stuck up at the back, just as Harrys did.', 'Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.', '\"Mom?\"', 'he whispered.', '\"Dad?\"', 'They just looked at him, smiling.', 'And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harrys knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.', 'The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them.', 'He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.', 'How long he stood there, he didnt know.', 'The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.', 'He couldnt stay here, he had to find his way back to bed.', 'He tore his eyes away from his mothers face, whispered, \"Ill come back,\" and hurried from the room.', '\"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly.', '\"You can come tonight, Im going back, I want to show you

can see them any old time,\" said Ron.', '\"Just come round my house this summer.', 'Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people.', 'Shame about not finding Flamel, though.', 'Have some bacon or something, why arent you eating anything?\"', 'Harry couldnt eat.', 'He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight.', 'He had almost forgotten about Flamel.', 'It didnt seem very important anymore.', 'Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?', 'What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?', '\"Are you all right?\"', 'said Ron.', '\"You look odd.\"', 'What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again.', 'With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night.', 'They tried retracing Harrys route

somewhere.\"', 'They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else.', 'just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.', '\"Its here -- just here -- yes!\"', 'They pushed the door open.', 'Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.', 'There they were.', 'His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.', '\"See?\"', 'Harry whispered.', '\"I cant see anything.\"', '\"Look!', 'Look at them all... there are loads of them....\" \"I can only see you.\"', '\"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\"', 'Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldnt see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.', 'Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.', '\"Look at me!\"', 'he said.', '\"Can you see all your family standing around you?\"', '\"No -- Im alone -- but Im different -- I look older -- and Im head boy!\"',

a bit more time.\"', '\"Youre only holding the Quidditch cup, whats interesting about that?', 'I want to see my parents.\"', '\"Dont push me --\" A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.', 'They hadnt realized how loudly they had been talking.', '\"Quick!\"', 'Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door.', 'Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats?', 'After what seemed an age, she turned and left.', '\"This isnt safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.', 'Come on.\"', 'And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.', 'The snow still hadnt melted the next morning.', '\"Want to play chess, Harry?\"', 'said Ron.', '\"No.\"', '\"Why dont we go down and visit

third night he found his way more quickly than before.', 'He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didnt meet anyone.', 'And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily.', 'Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror.', 'There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family.', 'Nothing at all.', 'Except -- \"So -- back again, Harry?\"', 'Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice.', 'He looked behind him.', 'Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.', 'Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadnt noticed him. \"', '-- I didnt see you, sir.\"', '\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.', '\"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\"', '\"I didnt know it was called that, Sir.\"', '\"But I expect youve realized by now what it does?\"', '\"It -- well -- it shows me my family --\" \"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\"', '\"How did you know --?\"', '\"I dont need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently.', '\"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\"', 'Harry shook his head.', '\"Let me explain.', 'The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is.', 'Does that help?\"', 'Harry thought.', 'Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want... whatever we want...\" \"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly.', '\"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.', 'You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you.', 'Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them.', 'However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth.', 'Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.', '\"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again.', 'If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared.', 'It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.', 'Now, why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\"', 'Harry stood up.', '\"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore?', 'Can I ask you something?\"', '\"Obviously, youve just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled.', '\"You may ask me one more thing, however.\"', '\"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\"', '\"I?', 'I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\"', 'Harry stared.', '\"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore.', '\"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didnt get a single pair.', 'People will insist on giving me books.\"', 'It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that

green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.', '\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.', 'Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things.', 'She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught

practice had started again.', 'Wood was working the team harder than ever.', 'Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnt dampen his spirits.', 'The Weasleys complained that Wood was

have quite the effect shed expected.', '\"The what?\"', 'said Harry and Ron.', '\"Oh, honestly, dont you two read?', 'Look -- read that, there.\"', 'She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron

whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went.', 'At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own.', 'Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry.', 'Could Snape possibly know theyd found out about the Sorcerers Stone?', 'Harry didnt see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.', 'Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive again.', 'This wasnt what youd call comforting.', 'Harry hardly heard a word of Woods pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.',

never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione.', '\"Look -theyre off Ouch!\"', 'Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head.', 'It was Malfoy.', '\"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didnt see you there.\"',

awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him.', 'Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.', '\"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\"', 'said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all.', '\"Its people they feel sorry for.', 'See, theres Potter, whos got no parents, then theres the Weasleys, whove got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, youve got no

stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.', '\"Im warning you, Malfoy -- one more word \"Ron!\"', 'said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry --\" \"What?', 'Where?\"', 'Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.', 'Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.', '\"Youre in luck, Weasley, Potters obviously spotted some money on the ground!\"', 'said Malfoy.', 'Ron snapped.', 'Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground.', 'Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.', '\"Come on, Harry!\"', 'Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didnt even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.', 'Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.', 'The stands erupted; it

the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes.', 'As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledores smiling face.', '\"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.', '\"Nice to see you havent been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent...\" Snape spat bitterly on the ground.', 'Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed.', 'He couldnt ever remember feeling happier.', 'Hed really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more.', 'The evening air had never smelled so sweet.', 'He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.', 'Harry had reached the shed.', 'He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.', 'Gryffindor in the lead.', 'Hed done

their trunks were packed, Nevilles toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope theyll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Botts Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into

      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",

owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",
      "CHAPTER THREE\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs

Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not

isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",
      "CHAPTER FOUR\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been

confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",
      "CHAPTER FIVE\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed

reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's

things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day

it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all

front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into

down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange

      "CHAPTER SIX\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and

Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",
      "CHAPTER EIGHT\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second

close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green

more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",
      "CHAPTER NINE\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a

I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and

was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",
      "CHAPTER TEN\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said

have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp

reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son

eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day

growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as

careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was

they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into

down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange

turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect

      "CHAPTER ELEVEN\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting

it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better

gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all

garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",

      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything

Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",
      "CHAPTER FOURTEEN\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat

isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to

was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak

sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",
      "CHAPTER FIFTEEN\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars

planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \n",
      "CHAPTER SIXTEEN\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not

 sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black

flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead

it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said

      "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n",
      "  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry

      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed

what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were

Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining

pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was

off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles

Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very

they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",

to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man

Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything

Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something

snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of

fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of

traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed

him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were

Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining

he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",
      "   ('THE BOY WHO LIVED  ', \"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was

off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles

Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very

Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam  he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about  People in cloaks  Mr  Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people  He supposed this was some stupid new fashion  He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \", {'compound': 0.9995, 'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.106})\n",

       "\"  Mr  and Mrs  Dursley  of number four  Privet Drive  were proud to say that they were perfectly normal  thank you very much  They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious  because they just didn't hold with such nonsense   Mr  Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings  which made drills  He was a big  beefy man with hardly any neck  although he did have a very large mustache  Mrs  Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck  which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences  spying on the neighbors  The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere   The Dursleys had everything they wanted  but they also had a secret  and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it  They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters  Mrs  Potter was Mrs  Dursley's sister  but they hadn't met for several years  in fact  Mrs  Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister  because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be  The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street  The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son  too  but they had never even seen him  This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away  they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that   When Mr  and Mrs  Dursley woke up on the dull  gray Tuesday our story starts  there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country  Mr  Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work  and Mrs  Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair   None of them noticed a large  tawny owl flutter past the window   At half past eight  Mr  Dursley picked up his briefcase  pecked Mrs  Dursley on the cheek  and tried to kiss Dudley good bye but missed  because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls   Little tyke  chortled Mr  Dursley as he left the house  He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive   It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map  For a second  Mr  Dursley didn't realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again  There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive  but there wasn't a map in sight  What could he have been thinking of  It must have been a trick of the light  Mr  Dursley blinked and stared at the cat  It stared back  As Mr  Dursley drove around the corner and up the road  he watched the cat in his mirror  It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no  looking at the sign  cats couldn't read maps or signs  Mr  Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind  As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day   But on the edge of town  drills were driven out of his mind by something else  As he sat in

close by  They were whispering excitedly together  Mr  Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all  why  that man had to be older than he was  and wearing an emerald green cloak  The nerve of him  But then it struck Mr  Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt   these people were obviously collecting for something   yes  that would be it  The traffic moved on and a few minutes later  Mr  Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot  his mind back on drills   Mr  Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor  If he hadn't  he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning  He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight  though people down in the street did  they pointed and gazed open  mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead  Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime  Mr  Dursley  however  had a perfectly normal  owl free morning  He yelled at five different people  He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more  He was in a very good mood until lunchtime  when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery   He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's  He eyed them angrily as he passed  He didn't know why  but they made him uneasy  This bunch were whispering excitedly  too  and he couldn't see a single collecting tin  It was on his way back past them  clutching a large doughnut in a bag  that he caught a few words of what they were saying   The Potters  that's right  that's what I heard yes  their son  Harry   Mr  Dursley stopped dead  Fear flooded him  He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them  but thought better of it   He dashed back across the road  hurried up to his office  snapped at his secretary not to disturb him  seized his telephone  and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind  He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache  thinking  no  he was being stupid  Potter wasn't such an unusual name  He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry  Come to think of it  he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry  He'd never even seen the boy  It might have been Harvey  Or Harold  There was no point in worrying Mrs  Dursley  she always got so upset at any mention of her sister  He didn't blame her   if he'd had a sister like that  but all the same  those people in cloaks   He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock  he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door   Sorry  he grunted  as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell  It was a few seconds before Mr  Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak  He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground  On the contrary  his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare   Don't be sorry  my dear sir  for nothing could upset me today  Rejoice  for You Know Who has gone at last  Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating  this happy  happy day   And the old man hugged Mr  Dursley around the middle and walked off   Mr  Dursley stood rooted to the spot  He had been hugged by a complete stranger  He also thought he had been called a Muggle  whatever that was  He was rattled  He hurried to his car and set off for home  hoping he was imagining things  which he had never hoped before  because he didn't approve of imagination   As he pulled into the driveway of number four  the first thing he saw   and it didn't improve his mood   was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning  It was now sitting on his garden wall  He was sure it was the same one  it had the same markings around its eyes   Shoo  said Mr  Dursley loudly  The cat didn't move  It just gave him a stern look  Was this normal cat behavior  Mr  Dursley wondered  Trying to pull himself together  he let himself into the house  He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife   Mrs  Dursley had had a nice  normal day  She told him over dinner all about Mrs  Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word  Won't  Mr  Dursley tried to act normally  When Dudley had been put to bed  he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news   And finally  bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today  Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight  there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise  Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern  The newscaster allowed himself a grin   Most mysterious  And now  over to Jim McGuffin with the weather  Going to be any more showers of owls tonight  Jim   Well  Ted  said the weatherman   I don't know about that  but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today  Viewers as far apart as Kent  Yorkshire  and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday  they've had a downpour of shooting stars  Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it's not until next week  folks  But I can promise a wet night tonight   Mr  Dursley sat frozen in his armchair  Shooting stars all over Britain  Owls flying by daylight  Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place  And a whisper  a whisper about the Potters   Mrs  Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea  It was no good  He'd have to say something to her  He cleared his throat nervously   Er   Petunia  dear   you haven't heard from your sister lately  have you   As he had expected  Mrs  Dursley looked shocked and angry  After all  they normally pretended she didn't have a sister   No  she said sharply   Why   Funny stuff on the news  Mr  Dursley mumbled   Owls  shooting stars  and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today   So  snapped Mrs  Dursley   Well  I just thought  maybe  it was something to do with  you know  her crowd   Mrs  Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips  Mr  Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name  Potter  He decided he didn't dare  Instead he said  as casually as he could   Their son   he'd be about Dudley's age now  wouldn't he   I suppose so  said Mrs  Dursley stiffly   What's his name again  Howard  isn't it   Harry  Nasty  common name  if you ask me   Oh  yes  said Mr  Dursley  his heart sinking horribly   Yes  I quite agree   He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed   While Mrs  Dursley was in the bathroom  Mr  Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden  The cat was still there   It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something   Was he imagining things  Could all this have anything to do with the Potters  If it did  if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well  he didn't think he could bear it   The Dursleys got into bed  Mrs  Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr  Dursley lay awake  turning it all over in his mind  His last  comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved  there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs  Dursley  The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind  He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn't affect them   How very wrong he was   Mr  Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep  but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness  It was sitting as still as a statue  its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive  It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street  nor when two owls swooped overhead  In fact  it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all   A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching  appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground  The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed   Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive  He was tall  thin  and very old  judging by the silver of his hair and beard  which were both long enough to tuck into his belt  He was wearing long robes  a purple cloak that swept the ground  and high heeled  buckled boots   His blue eyes were light  bright  and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked  as though it had been broken at least twice  This man's name was Albus Dumbledore   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome  He was busy rummaging in his cloak  looking for something  But he did seem to realize he was being watched  because he looked up suddenly at the cat  which was still staring at him from the other end of the street  For some reason  the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him  He chuckled and muttered   I should have known   He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket  It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter  He flicked it open  held it up in the air  and clicked it  The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop  He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness  Twelve times he clicked the Put Outer  until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance  which were the eyes of the cat watching him  If anyone looked out of their window now  even beady eyed Mrs  Dursley  they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement  Dumbledore slipped the Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four  where he sat down on the wall next to the cat  He didn't look at it  but after a moment he spoke to it   Fancy seeing you here  Professor McGonagall   He turned to smile at the tabby  but it had gone  Instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes  She  too  was wearing a cloak  an emerald one  Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun  She looked distinctly ruffled   How did you know it was me  she asked   My dear Professor  I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly   You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day  said Professor McGonagall   All day  When you could have been celebrating  I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily   Oh yes  everyone's celebrating  all right  she said impatiently   You'd think they'd be a bit more careful  but no   even the Muggles have noticed something's going on  It was on their news  She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living room window   I heard it  Flocks of owls  shooting stars  Well  they're not completely stupid  They were bound to notice something  Shooting stars down in Kent   I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle  He never had much sense   You can't blame them  said Dumbledore gently   We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years   I know that  said Professor McGonagall irritably   But that's no reason to lose our heads  People are being downright careless  out on the streets in broad daylight  not even dressed in Muggle clothes  swapping rumors   She threw a sharp  sideways glance at Dumbledore here  as though hoping he was going to tell her something  but he didn't  so she went on   A fine thing it would be if  on the very day YouKnow Who seems to have disappeared at last  the Muggles found out about us all  I suppose he really has gone  Dumbledore   It certainly seems so  said Dumbledore   We have much to be thankful for  Would you care for a lemon drop   A what   A lemon drop  They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of   No  thank you  said Professor McGonagall coldly  as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops   As I say  even if You Know Who has gone    My dear Professor  surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name  All this 'You  Know Who' nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name  Voldemort  Professor McGonagall flinched  but Dumbledore  who was unsticking two lemon drops  seemed not to notice   It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You Know Who ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name   I know you haven 't  said Professor McGonagall  sounding half exasperated  half admiring   But you're different  Everyone knows you're the only one You Know  oh  all right  Voldemort  was frightened of   You flatter me  said Dumbledore calmly   Voldemort had powers I will never have   Only because you're too   well   noble to use them   It's lucky it's dark  I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs   Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said   The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around  You know what everyone's saying  About why he's disappeared  About what finally stopped him   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss  the real reason she had been waiting on a cold  hard wall all day  for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now  It was plain that whatever  everyone  was saying  she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true  Dumbledore  however  was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer   What they're saying  she pressed on   is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow  He went to find the Potters  The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they're   dead     Dumbledore bowed his head  Professor McGonagall gasped   Lily and James  I can't believe it  I didn't want to believe it   Oh  Albus   Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder   I know  I know  he said heavily   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on   That's not all   They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son  Harry  But   he couldn't  He couldn't kill that little boy  No one knows why  or how  but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter  Voldemort's power somehow broke   and that's why he's gone   Dumbledore nodded glumly   It's   it's true  faltered Professor McGonagall   After all he's done  all the people he's killed  he couldn't kill a little boy  It's just astounding  of all the things to stop him  but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive   We can only guess  said Dumbledore   We may never know   Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles  Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it  It was a very odd watch   It had twelve hands but no numbers  instead  little planets were moving around the edge  It must have made sense to Dumbledore  though  because he put it back in his pocket and said   Hagrid's late  I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here  by the way   Yes  said Professor McGonagall   And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here  of all places   I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle  They're the only family he has left now   You don't mean   you can't mean the people who live here  cried Professor McGonagall  jumping to her feet and pointing at number four   Dumbledore   you can't  I've been watching them all day  You couldn't find two people who are less like us  And they've got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street  screaming for sweets   Harry Potter come and live here   It's the best place for him  said Dumbledore firmly   His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older  I've written them a letter   A letter  repeated Professor McGonagall faintly  sitting back down on the wall   Really  Dumbledore  you think you can explain all this in a letter  These people will never understand him  He'll be famous   a legend   I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name   Exactly  said Dumbledore  looking very seriously over the top of his half moon glasses   It would be enough to turn any boy's head  Famous before he can walk and talk  Famous for something he won't even remember  CarA you see how much better off he'll be  growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth  changed her mind  swallowed  and then said   Yes   yes  you're right  of course  But how is the boy getting here  Dumbledore  She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it   Hagrid's bringing him   You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this   I would trust Hagrid with my life  said Dumbledore   I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place  said Professor McGonagall grudgingly   but you can't pretend he's not careless  He does tend to   what was that   A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them  It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight  it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them   If the motorcycle was huge  it was nothing to the man sitting astride it  He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide  He looked simply too big to be allowed  and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face  he had hands the size of trash can lids  and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins  In his vast  muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets   Hagrid  said Dumbledore  sounding relieved   At last  And where did you get that motorcycle   Borrowed it  Professor Dumbledore  sit  said the giant  climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke   Young Sirius Black lent it to me  I've got him  sir   No problems  were there   No  sir   house was almost destroyed  but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around  He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets  Inside  just visible  was a baby boy  fast asleep  Under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut  like a bolt of lightning   Is that where   whispered Professor McGonagall   Yes  said Dumbledore   He'll have that scar forever   Couldn't you do something about it  Dumbledore   Even if I could  I wouldn't  Scars can come in handy  I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground  Well   give him here  Hagrid   we'd better get this over with   Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house   Could I   could I say good bye to him  sir  asked Hagrid  He bent his great  shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy  whiskery kiss  Then  suddenly  Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog   Shhh  hissed Professor McGonagall   you'll wake the Muggles   S s sorry  sobbed Hagrid  taking out a large  spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it   But I c c can't stand it   Lily an' James dead   an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles    Yes  yes  it's all very sad  but get a grip on yourself  Hagrid  or we'll be found  Professor McGonagall whispered  patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door  He laid Harry gently on the doorstep  took a letter out of his cloak  tucked it inside Harry's blankets  and then came back to the other two  For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle  Hagrid's shoulders shook  Professor McGonagall blinked furiously  and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out   Well  said Dumbledore finally   that's that  We've no business staying here  We may as well go and join the celebrations   Yeah  said Hagrid in a very muffled voice   I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back  G'night  Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore  sir   Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve  Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life  with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night   I shall see you soon  I expect  Professor McGonagall  said Dumbledore  nodding to her  Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply   Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street  On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put Outer  He clicked it once  and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street  He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four   Good luck  Harry  he murmured  He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak  he was gone   A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive  which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky  the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen  Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up  One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on  not knowing he was special  not knowing he was famous  not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs  Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles  nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley  He couldn't know that at this very moment  people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices   To Harry Potter   the boy who lived   \""
